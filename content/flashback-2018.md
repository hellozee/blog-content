**tl;dr**, Typical end of the year post as you may expect.

Well, 2018 was a significantly productive year for me compared to other years, learned so many things which I wanted to, plus added more things to the bucket list for the coming year. And you know what I am only going to talk about those in this post.

Let me draw a timeline of the events happened this year:

- **January** :  
  * Installed **Gentoo**, finally, something I wanted to do after installing Arch but never got the confidence.
  * Started out [cook](https://github.com/hellozee/cook), a build system for me cause I could not get CMake.
- **February** : 
  * My first open source contribution, a small [patch](https://phabricator.kde.org/D10202) for Krita.
  * Was working on another patch, sadly never completed it, hush.
- **March** :
  * Another open source contribution this time for [Inkscape](https://gitlab.com/inkscape/inkscape/merge_requests/214/diffs?commit_id=d245ec39ef11b6836fc0f8e8ce98222954344a05), ohh yeahh.
  * Took a session on Portage Package Manager in IIITD, first technical speaking experience, was tough, missed many points, no one cares now. :stuck_out_tongue:
  * Raspberry Pi Jam, how can I miss it, the first time I tried my hands on any single board computer.
- **April** :
  * Attended my first hackathon, fortunately, we never made past the initial pitch.
  * Can use cook for my projects, my first project which made it to the usable stage.
  * Installed **LFS**, you read that right, Linux From Scratch, though didn't use it for more than a week.
- **May** :
  * Started working on [fixture](https://github.com/eyeon/Fixture), got tired of running a virtual machine for Photoshop.
  * An attempt to automate drawing posters for ILUGD, [splatter](https://github.com/eyeon/Fixture), sadly, now when I think of it, I don't remember the last time I worked on it.
- **June** :
  * Got my domain, set up my mail, all the credit goes to Github to offer me those.
  * Wrote a Lua script for doing the marvel intro in BlackMagic Design Fusion, something which opened a brand new domain for exploring to me. 
  * Redid my website and set up the current blog using hugo.
  * My first patch for the flag module of Golang got merged, was only a doc patch nevertheless. 
  * Started working on a rasterizer, [fragment](https://github.com/hellozee/fragment).
- **July** :
  * Was working on fixture, apart from that, Qt Forums was quite nicer than StackOverflow.
- **August** :
  * As always I added another project, this time it was a ray tracer, [coo](https://github.com/hellozee/coo), but recently I just dumped it and archived the repo, writing a ray tracer in c was not my cup of tea.
  * Started learning CMake, finally, that scripting language is pretty ugly, but well CMake made my life a lot easier than thought.
- **September** :
  * Round Robin-ing my projects, academics suck, such a lame month, I had.
  * One year at India Linux Users Group - Delhi, wow.
- **October** :
  * PyCon India, my first ever conference, which I attended as a volunteer, hesitated at first, but, now I am not going to miss any conference which I can afford to go.
  * That feeling when you sculpt someone else's project, like your own, thanks to [dexer](https://github.com/farhaanbukhsh/file-indexer).
  * Mozilla, here comes my first [patch](https://github.com/mozilla/sops/pull/387) for you.
- **November** :
  * Multiple docs patches into Golang, which are, ermm, still not accepted, looks like my Pull Requests got lost in the heap, hope someone merges them.
  * Tired of c, decided to write another ray tracer using c++ now, [frey](https://github.com/hellozee/frey), unfinished, but has tests and docs, what more does someone want, :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:
  * Bought a Raspberry Pi, yeah, finally, saved enough.
- **December** :
  * Redid that marvel script for Nuke, this time in Python, with more features.
  * Built my own image for the Raspberry Pi, thanks to BuildRoot to make this as easy as shopping on amazon.

### Summarizing

- College sucks, the month which was the most productive had zero days of college.
- I have a lot of unfinished projects which I need to finish quickly before starting any more.

#### What did I learn?

- Can take a wild guess at the dimensions of Linux.
- Test-driven development is a nice approach, which prevents a lot of headaches.
- Interact more, unless you interact, you will be as idiot as you were yesterday.
- Pulling stunts is necessary, only after coming down, I realized what I did inside Adobe.*

##### *Only people who know me, will get this, :wink:

### The List :laughing:

- Complete both the rasterizer and the ray tracer.
- Learn Nuke, more aptly its Python API.
- Save enough for a 7" touchscreen for Pi.
- Do more patches for upstream projects.



Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year, `:wq` for now.
