> C++ folks think they are smartest in the room. The truth is C++ is a niche language and is only be used when someone needs performance.

A random person to me in a Python meetup when I was showing some python-like syntax, that the new C++ versions offer. While I do agree to some part of it but I strongly disagree to the rest. Honestly I didn't have an answer to it at that point nor do I have one now.

> C++ folks think they are smartest in the room

This was quite bold of them to assume or did I do something which provoked them to say this? They came to me, asking about modern C++ and I tried to answer their queries. They had more words than me to drop in the conversation about C++. Though most of their talk was just some smart guessing of how `constexpr` works which I wasn't aware of. Later as I went through the references they turned out to be wrong, wow, not that surprising.

Enough preface, lets get to the point, is C++ a niche language? A lot of them will answer yes, why? Of course C++ doesn't have any place in hot job markets like

 - `import tensorflow as tf` engineer
 - `import pandas as pd` scientist
 - `import numpy as np` expert
 - `./manage.py migrate` developer'
 
From this perspective pure C++ developers are rare to encounter and hence are niche. But answer this following questions of mine?

 - Which is the most probably Operating System?
 - In which language the kernel is written?
 - In which language the userspace tools which come with it, is written?
 - You use some browser to view webpages right, could you tell me in what language it is written?
 - Do you have any electronic appliances in your house? * me smirks *
