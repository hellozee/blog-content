With everyone getting back into work, we have managed to control the number of bugs. There are 2 fewer bugs than what I reported last time. I know it is still not a lot, but with Dmitry not available for most of the time and team having to divide its time between the resource rewrite & bug fixing, it is pretty good that the number is decreasing.

The commit history surely tells that Boud did a [Coverity](https://scan.coverity.com/) scan and fixed a lot of issues identified by it. Tiar is busy fixing OpenEXR. She also amended the manual a bit regarding all different logs and back-traces that one can get out of Krita. Other than she has also made herself available for documenting some of the code related to resource rewrite. As I said earlier Dmitry is on parental leave, but he still managed to pull off a couple of patches in the last two weeks while trying to fix the transform tool bugs.

Ramon is gearing up for a new video about the brush engine for our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkIccKaHDGA8lYVmUerLhag), don't forget to subscribe so you won't miss. Ivan is deep into bug fixing and apart from that, he is also trying to get a multiple tip brush into play.

Apart from those, as a part of Season of KDE, Amyspark would be working on fixing the floating-point operations on CMYK and Lab color-spaces. Also, there is a mixer slider docker in Krita now thanks to Tusooa which allows you to choose from the gradient between two colors.
