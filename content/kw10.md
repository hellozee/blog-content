Honestly, you don't want to know the number of bugs in our bug tracker at this point. But I assure you these are just our broken unit tests rather than bugs. Recently Boud decided to mark every broken unit test as a bug in the hope that it would have higher chances of getting fixed. Why do we need to fix the broken unit tests? Of course, if all of our unit tests ran properly the chances that a bug would trickle down a release would be lesser.

Surprisingly Dmitry is able to devote a part of his time to work, along with his newfound responsibility. With that being said, he also started cracking nerdy dad jokes these days. Taking a look at the commit history, Dmitry can be found fixing the broken unit tests and the regressions which got introduced to the transform tool in his absence.

Boud says he would like to get back to continue doing the resource rewrite but a recent upgrade to Python 3.8 has made him stuck with fixing build system. Some new changes were introduced in Python 3.8 for tackling the DLL hell which broke our builds. And unless the situation is fixed, this would only cause a delay our next release.

Though Boud was busy with release stuff, Tiar was working with the resource rewrite stuff, fortunately, the more work which goes into the resource rewrite the more the closer we get to our 4.3 release.

Ivanyossi thinks he got an idea to improve the performance of Krita in MacOS, hopefully, he can reduce the number the complaints we get of Krita in MacOS. Apple not liking open source is not our fault, but users don't care for the most of the part, pfft.

Other than that, Sharaf has been dropping small patches to fixing little naggings present in the Android port. And most likely, by the next release, we would have Krita up in F-Droid for curious artists on Android. Also Amyspark has also been able to fix the subtleties in CMYK and Lab colorspaces.
