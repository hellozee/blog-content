### Preface

Okay, so recently one of Boud's [posts](https://valdyas.org/fading/hacking/krita-hacking/back-from-the-blender-conference-2019/) sparked some conversations in [hackernews](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21357906) and [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/krita/comments/dn0djy/back_from_the_blender_conference_2019_krita/). So this is my part of taking care of a couple of the points raised in those discussions. Also, I was running out of ideas to blog about every week, so it is just killing two birds with one stone.

### What happened last week, then?

Last week we had a mini sprint, in Amsterdam, attending that were 4 of the 5 paid developers of Krita,

 - Boud, of course the maintainer of Krita and the chairman of the Stichting Krita Foundation.
 - Dmitry, the guy who implemented HDR in Krita.
 - Tiar, our chief bug wrangler, can be found in [/r/krita](/r/krita) most of time.
 - Wolthera, the maintainer of the Krita Manual.

The main purpose of the sprint was to meet Jonas and Fred, two of our Intel contacts, who has been working with us for a long time now. And as we are approaching the 4.3 release, the team had a long productive discussion on the resource rewrite which has been going on for a while now. There's a lot to be done still but the basics have been handled and the rest of the work will be split over Boud, Tiar and Wolthera.

Post the sprint, the team went for the awesome Blender Conference. We had a booth in there, demonstrating the HDR capabilities of Krita. And of course it was sponsored by Intel.

Other than that, the folks are working hard to fix the remaining of bugs, which is around 406, quite depressing to be honest. But fear not, in the last year we fixed around, 1529 bugs, while 1202 new bugs were filed, ahh, a net decrease of 327 bugs. Cherry on the top, even though not much of bug fixing has been done in the last week, the number of bugs hasn't grown that much, which means we are gaining stability with every passing day.

By the way, if you have any questions regarding krita, don't hesitate to drop me a mail to **hellozee at disroot dot org** or contact me through any of the social media accounts given below, `:wq` for now, till the next week.
