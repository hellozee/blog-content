So, a lot has been going around these days, 2020 hasn't been the best year so far. Nevertheless don't panic, maintain proper hygiene and you should be fine for the most part.

A couple of days back 4.2.9 beta was released, [here](https://krita.org/en/item/krita-4-2-9-beta-released/) a blog post detailing the release can be found. Tons of bug fixes and a bunch of new features are there, which leaves me nothing to write about them in the weekly.

In the other news, we have been able to hire Emmet and Eoin to work on the animation subsystem part-time. Previously both have contributed to the code and also joined the rest of us in the last two yearly sprints. [Here](https://phabricator.kde.org/T12769) is the task that is being laid upon to be worked. And they also have started a [survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfJ-cnxZy6mgbOBSOPWTQKEGx22SMKqmxC5sJGor-G1HFNT4w/viewform) for the folks interested in animation for Krita. The feedback would be helpful for us to decide which parts of the animation system need more attention.

The team is, as usual, focusing on the resource rewrite completely, with Ivan being dragged into focussing on MacOS packaging issues since a new version of Krita was released.

That's all for now, see you in the next post, `:wq`.
