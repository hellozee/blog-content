Well, I did manage to get some work done during the start of the week cause after that it was just dripping nose and back to back headaches along with a sore throat for around the next 3 days, and I also had to prepare for Krita sprints happening next week.

So what I have managed to add is an options widget to the tool, which somewhat looks like this, ![Magnetic Lasso Tool Options](/img/tool_options.png) <br>where radius determines the search area and threshold, the bar of determining how clear the edge is. And now I have to fix the bugs, polish out the checkpoint procedure, implement a cursor change on hover over the initial point, and also add some new cursors.

But honestly the most exciting part is the sprint, that I am going to attend, cause this will be the first time, I will going on a solo trip, that too out of the country and second I am going to meet the people with whom I have been chatting with, for the last year, :laughing:.

But before that, ILUGD is celebrating CircuitPython Day this Sunday, will talk more about that the coming week along with the sprint, till then, `:wq`
